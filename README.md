In this project, I analyse the electric vehicle poulation dataset (USA) to uncover critical insights into the electric car market. I examine key aspects such as the geographic distribution of electric cars, their make and model variations, and their eligibility for clean alternative fuel vehicle incentives. Additionally, I also investigate the role of electric utility companies powering these vehicles and explore price range distributions to identify trends and barriers within the market. By addressing these areas, I aim to highlight challenges and opportunities in accelerating electric car adoption.
